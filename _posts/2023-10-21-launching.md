## Launching

When you are building something it's never the right time to launch.
- The product is not right
- someone may rip off my idea and make it better
- There are so many obvious things I should do before I Launch
- I'll never get a second chance at a customer so you better do it right
- Should I start a real business and file a bunch of paperwork with all the costs and overhead associated?

And so you do what I did which is build something and then sit on it, revisiting it every couple weeks to make some tweaks.  Sharing with family and friends but never getting it out into the world.

## Today we Launch
So yesterday I sat down and made steps to move forward.
- Bit the bullet, finalized on a name, and bought a domain
- moved everything out of my personal account into accounts dedicated for what could be a future business (email, github, twitter, analytics, chromestore publisher, payments, etc..)
- Made a promo video
- Found a theme and built a landing site

## What's next
Marketing and talking to customers.  Need to get the word out, get feedback, and itterate fast.  Looking forward to what the future holds.
