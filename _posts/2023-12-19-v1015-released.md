v1.0.1.5 released

## v1.0.1.5 released
Today we released 1.0.1.5 which includes support for the much loved Ibotta.  Before we get to the details wanted to put out a reminder to share this with your friends and family and please submit product feedback if there are changes you would like to see or new sites you would like supported.  We love feedback!

## Now on to Ibotta

I leared about Ibotta from a few reddit communities including:

- https://www.reddit.com/r/ibotta
- https://www.reddit.com/r/couponing
- https://www.reddit.com/r/SavingMoney/
- https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/

Ibotta allows you to clip deals, then take a picture of your receipt and submit it to them for additional savings.  They employ some pretty stringent restrictions on clipping and if you clip too fast they will block you for a while.  Because of this the best way to use Lasso is to load it up, let it run, and walk away for a bit.  When you come back in 10-15 minutes they should be clipped.  Enjoy!
