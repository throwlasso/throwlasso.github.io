```
brew install ruby@2.7
export PATH="/usr/local/opt/ruby@2.7/bin:$PATH"
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

## Features

* Contact form

## Setup

1. Add your site and author details in `_config.yml`.
2. Add your Google Analytics and Disqus keys to `_config.yml`.
3. Get a workflow going to see your site's output (with [CloudCannon](https://app.cloudcannon.com/) or Jekyll locally).

## Develop

Hydra was built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) version 3.3.1, but should support newer versions as well.

Install the dependencies with [Bundler](http://bundler.io/):

~~~bash
$ bundle install
~~~

Run `jekyll` commands through Bundler to ensure you're using the right versions:

~~~bash
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
~~~

### Contact Form

* Preconfigured to work with CloudCannon, but easily changed to another provider (e.g. [FormSpree](https://formspree.io/)).
* Sends email to the address listed in company details.

### Staff

* Reused around the site to save multiple editing locations.
* Add `excluded_in_search: true` to any documentation page's front matter to exclude that page in the search results.

### Navigation

* Exposed as a data file to give clients better access.
* Set in the *Data* / *Navigation* section.

### Footer

* Exposed as a data file to give clients better access.
* Set in the *Data* / *Footer* section.
